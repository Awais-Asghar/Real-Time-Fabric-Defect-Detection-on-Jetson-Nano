Built a real-time, purely classical computer vision system for fabric defect detection using multi-method analysis (GLCM, FFT, Gabor, statistical variance, background subtraction, and edge–Hough), with IoU-based bounding box fusion for robust localization. Deployed and optimized the pipeline on Jetson Nano for real time defect detection.
